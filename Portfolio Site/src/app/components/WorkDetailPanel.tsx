      title: 'Self-Service Analytics at Scale',
      company: 'Chewy',
      challenge: 'Pre-IPO, Chewy\'s analytics environment was creating more problems than it solved: teams were rebuilding the same content independently, metrics didn\'t match across departments, nothing was discoverable, and duplicate work was rampant. There was no dev/prod separation, so SOX-sensitive reporting had zero protections or auditability. Meanwhile, 70% of our on-prem Vertica warehouse capacity was consumed by sandbox tables and ad-hoc analytics workloads, leaving minimal headroom for critical ETL processes. As Associate Director, I was accountable for transforming this into a governed, scalable self-service platform before IPO.',
      approach: [
        'Met each team where they were in their analytics journey—some needed hands-on optimization support, others just needed guardrails and autonomy',
        'Designed dev/prod separation that created SOX auditability while improving content quality and discoverability',
        'Focused on building valuable analytics that surfaced business drivers, not just dashboards that displayed metrics',
        'Established content certification so teams could find and trust existing assets instead of rebuilding from scratch'
      ],
      outcome: '35x user growth (100 to 3,500+) with maintained performance. Warehouse load reduced from 70% to 30% for analytics workloads, freeing capacity for ETL. Zero SOX audit findings through IPO and beyond. Platform team efficiency improved 7x—grew only 3 to 5 FTE despite 35x user growth.',
      keyInsight: 'Governance works when you meet people where they are. By supporting each team\'s unique analytics maturity rather than imposing one-size-fits-all rules, users became partners in quality rather than resistors of process.',

      title: 'Privacy Compliance at Scale',
      company: 'Chewy',
      challenge: 'Pre-IPO security audit revealed significant customer PII exposure in Splunk system logs—a compliance risk for SOX and CCPA that needed remediation before going public. As Director, I was accountable for eliminating this exposure, but engineering teams didn\'t want anything to do with it. They argued they needed the data for debugging, it slowed them down, and they pushed back constantly. I had no direct authority over the 30+ teams who needed to change their behavior.',
      approach: [
        'Led through influence, not authority—partnered directly with each engineering team to explain the "why" rather than mandating compliance',
        'Made the case that PII in logs was unnecessary, a privacy risk, and simply not best practice—winning over resistant teams by explaining business rationale',
        'Built automated PII detection in Splunk to identify patterns and track remediation progress across all applications',
        'Established sustainable governance mechanisms and trained 200+ engineers on privacy-safe logging practices'
      ],
      outcome: '97% reduction in PII across all system logs. Zero audit findings related to data exposure in IPO security reviews. Framework became standard practice for all new services, shifting engineering culture toward privacy-safe logging.',
      keyInsight: 'Cross-functional initiatives succeed when you lead with "why." Engineers resisted because they saw it as overhead—winning them over required explaining that PII in logs was unnecessary and risky, not just citing compliance rules.',

      title: 'Vendor Data Services',
      company: 'Chewy',
      challenge: 'Chewy\'s vendor partners had no self-service access to their own performance data. Without an official conduit, account managers faced constant pressure to share ad-hoc reports—putting Chewy at risk of sharing unvalidated data or exposing competitive information. As Director of BI & Data Governance, I saw an opportunity to treat data as a product: turn operational data into a revenue stream while establishing proper governance.',
      approach: [
        'Partnered directly with vendors during development to understand what they actually needed—their feedback shaped the product and built stronger relationships',
        'Designed secure external-facing platform with row-level security ensuring vendors only saw their own data',
        'Established an official, sanctioned channel for vendor data—replacing risky ad-hoc sharing with auditable, validated information',
        'Started with veterinary practice rebate tracking, then expanded to additional business units as the platform proved value'
      ],
      outcome: 'Generated $10M+ annual revenue from data that was previously just operational overhead. Eliminated 90% of ad-hoc vendor data requests. Platform eventually rolled into Vendor 360 portal. Strengthened vendor relationships by weaving Chewy more tightly into their data ecosystem.',
      keyInsight: 'Data teams should think like product teams. By partnering with vendors to build what they actually needed—not what we assumed—we created a product that deepened relationships while generating revenue. The official platform also served as a governance mechanism, protecting Chewy from the risks of ad-hoc data sharing.',

      title: 'Data Literacy at Scale',
      company: 'Chewy',
      challenge: 'Chewy had invested in robust analytics infrastructure, but adoption was concentrated within the central BI team. Teams were solving similar problems in isolation with no way to share knowledge. Traditional training didn\'t stick because it wasn\'t based in our data environment. As Director of BI & Data Governance, I needed to build data literacy and community to enable the self-service analytics strategy.',
      approach: [
        'Created Data Summit—a platform for team members to showcase their data products and get recognition, building community and discoverability across departments',
        'Created Data Basecamp—vendor-led training curated specifically to Chewy\'s environment, with beginner/intermediate/advanced tracks based on topics users wanted to learn',
        'Leveraged vendor relationships to deliver high-quality content (vendors wanted to be more deeply embedded in our usage)',
        'Built a learning library of recorded sessions based in our actual data stack—not generic examples'
      ],
      outcome: 'Grew from a half-day pilot (10 sessions) to a multi-day event (75+ sessions over 4 days). Trained 1,200+ employees over five years. Built learning library of Chewy-specific content. Programs became something people looked forward to—part of Chewy\'s culture.',
      keyInsight: 'Meet people where they are. Not everyone learns the same way—some want office hours, some want videos. But training curated to your environment, using your data, is far more impactful than generic content.',

      title: 'Product Analytics Audit',
      company: 'Chewy',
      challenge: 'Product teams struggled to measure feature performance because user interaction data was inconsistent across platforms. iOS, Android, and web had evolved independently for years—different schemas, different event names, different properties for the same actions. No one understood the full picture, and people blamed bots for the measurement inconsistencies. As Director, I was asked to figure out what was actually going on.',
      approach: [
        'Conducted 80+ interviews across 30 product and engineering teams to map the complete instrumentation workflow',
        'Discovered it took 124 discrete steps across multiple teams to instrument a new feature—creating months-long delays',
        'Documented how iOS/Android schema divergence made cross-platform customer journey analysis impossible',
        'Quantified business impact: ML models trained on inconsistent data, A/B tests confounded by platform differences',
        'Presented findings to C-suite with three options ranging from incremental fixes to full mobile re-architecture'
      ],
      outcome: 'The audit painted a clear picture of how broken things were—something no one had fully understood before. Findings informed roadmap planning for the following year. After my departure, iOS and Android teams were dissolved in favor of a unified web-flexible architecture.',
      keyInsight: 'Sometimes the highest-impact work is making invisible problems visible. The audit didn\'t fix anything directly—it gave leadership the evidence and options they needed to make a strategic decision.',

      title: 'Data Platform Optimization',
      company: 'Babylist',
      challenge: 'Babylist\'s Snowflake platform had grown organically during hypergrowth—costs were escalating faster than business value, P95 query latency was hurting analyst productivity, and the transformation layer was full of anti-patterns. As Director of BI & Data Engineering, I inherited a platform that needed modernization before it became a bottleneck for both daily operations and IPO readiness.',
      approach: [
        'Conducted hands-on audit of query logs, dbt code, and warehouse metrics—didn\'t delegate the investigation work',
        'Optimized dbt transformation layer: converted expensive tables to incremental models, refactored anti-patterns, added comprehensive testing',
        'Redesigned data mart architecture with proper clustering and flattened, analysis-ready structures',
        'Implemented cost governance with query tagging and team-level attribution dashboards',
        'Partnered with engineering to optimize Airflow orchestration and reduce redundant runs'
      ],
      outcome: '30% cost reduction (~$145K annual savings) through architectural optimization. 50% P95 query latency improvement enabling faster interactive analytics. 50% increase in active data users through better performance and self-service enablement.',
      keyInsight: 'Platform optimization is about discipline, not technology. The biggest wins came from simple changes done consistently—proper incremental models, right-sized warehouses, query tagging. No fancy technology, just fundamentals that had been skipped during hypergrowth.',

      title: 'Building an Analytics Organization',
      company: 'Chewy',
      challenge: 'When I joined Chewy in 2017 as a staff engineer building dashboards, there was no formal analytics function. The company was scaling rapidly toward its 2019 IPO and needed enterprise-grade analytics capabilities. I quickly became the platform owner as we moved to self-service, and over six years was given increasing responsibility as I proved myself—eventually leading multiple teams across BI, data governance, Splunk, and GRC.',
      approach: [
        'Started as staff engineer, became Associate Director, then Director as I took on more responsibility',
        'Grew the BI team to 5-6 people focused on platform support and self-service enablement',
        'Took on Data Governance team (4-5 people) as the function matured',
        'Inherited and grew Splunk team from 2 to 6 engineers',

      outcome: 'Built and absorbed teams totaling ~30 people across BI, Data Governance, Splunk, and GRC. Supported Chewy through IPO and continued scaling. Became a trusted leader who was given teams as the organization needed them.',
      keyInsight: 'Career growth isn\'t always about building one team from scratch—sometimes it\'s about being the trusted leader who gets given teams as you prove yourself. The common thread was governance, compliance, and enabling the organization to use data effectively.',

      title: 'Enterprise Data Governance',
      company: 'Chewy',
      challenge: 'Pre-IPO, Chewy lacked formal data governance. There was no data catalog, inconsistent metric definitions across teams, and growing regulatory requirements (CCPA, GDPR, SOX) without systematic controls. As Director of BI & Data Governance, I owned building this capability from scratch.',
      approach: [
        'Ran POCs and rolled out Alation as the data catalog—even during the pandemic, got teams to fill it out',

      company: 'Personal Project',
      challenge: 'Traditional resumes are static documents that can\'t answer follow-up questions or demonstrate technical depth. Recruiters often schedule calls just to understand if there\'s a fit.
