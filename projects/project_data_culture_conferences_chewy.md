# Project: Data Culture Building Through Conference Programs

**Role:** Senior Manager, Business Intelligence & Analytics | **Company:** Chewy | **Timeline:** June 2018 - August 2023 (5+ years)

## Executive Summary

Established and scaled two flagship internal conference programs—Data Summit and Data Basecamp—that transformed Chewy's data culture from centralized analytics to organization-wide data literacy. Starting with a 10-session pilot, these programs grew to deliver 75+ sessions per conference cycle, trained 1,200+ employees across beginner to advanced tracks, and created a learning library with 200+ Chewy-specific training modules. The initiatives accelerated self-service analytics adoption, strengthened vendor partnerships, and established data competency as a core organizational capability that supported Chewy's growth from pre-IPO startup to Fortune 500 company.

## Problem Statement

In 2018, Chewy was experiencing explosive growth—revenue doubling year-over-year, headcount expanding rapidly. But data literacy wasn't keeping pace. We had built robust analytics infrastructure (Tableau, Snowflake, Airflow), but adoption was concentrated within my central BI team. The broader organization treated data as something "the data team does for us," not something they could leverage independently.

**The Challenges:**

**Skill Gap:** New hires joined with varying levels of data proficiency. Marketing analysts might know Excel but not SQL. Product managers knew dashboards but not how to evaluate data quality. Finance teams understood forecasting but not distributed systems. We had no consistent baseline.

**Centralized Bottleneck:** My team of 15 analysts was fielding 200+ ad-hoc requests per month. Every dashboard, every query, every analysis ran through us. We were a bottleneck preventing the organization from moving at the speed it needed.

**Tool Proliferation Without Mastery:** Teams requested access to Tableau, Snowflake, Looker, Sigma—but once granted access, many users struggled to go beyond basic functionality. We had power tools being used as hammers.

**Lack of Community:** Data users worked in silos. Merchandising didn't know what Supply Chain was building. Finance was solving problems Marketing had already solved. No mechanism for cross-pollination of best practices.

**Vendor Relationships as Transactional:** We had contracts with Tableau, Snowflake, Alation, dbt—but weren't fully leveraging vendor expertise. Their training was generic (not Chewy-specific), and their customer success teams couldn't help without deeper engagement.

**The Opportunity:**

Rather than continuing to be *the* data team, we needed to become **the data enablement team**. Our goal: transform Chewy into an organization where every business user had the skills, confidence, and community support to answer their own data questions.

The question wasn't "How do we hire more analysts?" It was **"How do we make every employee an analyst?"**

## Success Criteria

**Adoption & Reach:**
1. Train 500+ employees in Year 1, scaling to 1,000+ by Year 3
2. Achieve 80%+ participant satisfaction scores (post-event surveys)
3. Grow from single-day event (10 sessions) to multi-day conference (75+ sessions)

**Self-Service Impact:**
4. Reduce ad-hoc request volume to central BI team by 40%
5. Increase Tableau adoption from 100 users to 3,500+ users
6. Grow embedded analysts from 0 to 15+ business units

**Content Quality & Sustainability:**
7. Build library of 100+ recorded sessions specific to Chewy tech stack
8. Create reusable learning paths (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
9. Establish vendor partnerships delivering Chewy-customized training

**Cultural Indicators:**
10. Create "data community" Slack channel with 500+ active members
11. Establish peer-to-peer learning (users teaching users, not just BI team teaching)
12. Generate grassroots demand for training (users requesting, not leadership mandating)

---

## Constraints & Challenges

**Budget Constraints:**

**No Dedicated Training Budget:** Initially, no budget for external trainers, venues, or catering. Had to bootstrap using internal resources and vendor partnerships.

**Opportunity Cost:** Every hour spent building training content was an hour not spent on analytics projects. Had to balance enablement vs. execution.

**Organizational Constraints:**

**Distributed Workforce:** Chewy had offices in Boston, Florida, and remote workers. Single-location events excluded significant portions of the organization.

**Competing Priorities:** Business units wanted "more analysts" to build content for them, not "training" to build content themselves. Had to prove training ROI.

**Time Scarcity:** Employees were busy. A 2-day conference meant 16 hours away from their day jobs. Hard to justify unless content was exceptional.

**Technical Challenges:**

**Diverse Skill Levels:** Same audience included Excel-only users and SQL experts. Creating content that served everyone was difficult.

**Chewy-Specific Context:** Generic Tableau training didn't help. Users needed to understand *our* data models, *our* governance, *our* use cases.

**Vendor Coordination:** Data vendors (Tableau, Snowflake, Alation) each wanted their own dedicated event. Coordinating schedules and ensuring content complementarity was complex.

**Cultural Resistance:**

**"Not My Job" Mindset:** Some stakeholders believed data analysis should be centralized. Pushing self-service required changing expectations.

**Fear of Doing It Wrong:** Many potential users avoided data tools because "I might break something" or "I might make a wrong decision." Had to build psychological safety.

---

## Solution Architecture

Rather than a single conference, we created a **year-round data enablement ecosystem** anchored by two flagship events:

### Program Structure

**1. Data Summit (Twice Yearly: June & December)**

**Format:** Showcase & Inspiration
- 1-day event, 20-30 sessions across 3 tracks
- Focus: "What's possible with data at Chewy?"
- Content: Case studies, success stories, best practices from internal teams

**Target Audience:** All data users, business leaders, cross-functional stakeholders

**Session Types:**
- **Showcase Sessions:** Teams presented analytics projects (e.g., "How Supply Chain reduced waste using predictive modeling")
- **Tool Deep-Dives:** "Hidden features of Tableau you're not using"
- **Strategy Talks:** "The future of data at Chewy" (from my team or executives)

**Goal:** Inspire adoption and demonstrate ROI of data investments

---

**2. Data Basecamp (Twice Yearly: April & October)**

**Format:** Hands-On Training
- 2-day event, 40-50 sessions across 5 skill tracks
- Focus: "Build your data skills progressively"
- Content: Instructor-led workshops, labs, office hours

**Skill Tracks:**
- **Beginner:** "Tableau 101", "SQL Basics", "How to Read a Dashboard"
- **Intermediate:** "Joins & Aggregations", "LOD Calculations in Tableau", "Data Quality Fundamentals"
- **Advanced:** "Optimizing Query Performance", "Building Reusable Data Models", "Governance & Compliance"
- **Vendor Track:** Tableau, Snowflake, Alation, dbt Labs delivered Chewy-specific training
- **Domain Track:** Finance-specific analytics, Marketing attribution modeling, Supply Chain forecasting

**Target Audience:** Active data users seeking to deepen skills

**Session Types:**
- **Workshops:** 90-minute hands-on labs with real Chewy data
- **Office Hours:** 30-minute Q&A with subject matter experts
- **Certification Prep:** Study sessions for Tableau Desktop Specialist, Snowflake SnowPro

**Goal:** Build proficiency and enable self-sufficiency

### Vendor Partnership Model

One of the keys to scaling these programs was **leveraging vendor resources**:

**What We Offered Vendors:**
- Dedicated speaking slots at Data Basecamp
- Access to our user base (600+ employees per event)
- Feedback on product pain points
- Case study opportunities (Chewy success stories for their marketing)

**What Vendors Provided:**
- Free training delivered by their customer success teams
- Chewy-specific customization (using our data, dashboards, workflows)
- Training materials we could record and reuse
- Swag, prizes, and sponsorship (offset costs)

**Result:** We created a win-win. Vendors got exposure and engagement. We got free, high-quality training content.

## Execution & Leadership

### Team Structure

**Core Organizing Team:**
- **Myself (Program Lead):** Vision, vendor partnerships, executive alignment, budget
- **Senior Analyst (Content Curator):** Session proposals, speaker coaching, track design
- **BI Engineer (Logistics Lead):** Scheduling, AV setup, recording, platform management
- **Marketing Partner (0.25 FTE):** Event branding, communications, Slack channel management

**Extended Support:**
- **Guest Presenters (30-50 per event):** Internal employees and vendor partners
- **Executive Sponsors:** VP of Data, CTO (opening keynotes, budget approvals)

### My Leadership Role

**1. Vision & Strategic Alignment**

I positioned these conferences not as "training" (which sounds like cost) but as **"data democratization"** (which sounds like strategy). In executive updates, I framed the programs as:
- Enabling self-service (reducing BI team bottleneck)
- Accelerating innovation (business units moving faster)
- Retention tool (employees valued learning opportunities)

This framing secured budget and protected the programs during cost-cutting cycles.

**2. Vendor Relationship Management**

I personally cultivated relationships with our key vendors:
- Quarterly business reviews where we discussed training needs
- Invited vendor executives to speak at Data Summit (great for their visibility)
- Shared user feedback to influence product roadmaps

These relationships gave us access to resources we couldn't afford otherwise (trainers, content, swag).

**3. Cross-Functional Coalition Building**

Success required buy-in from business unit leaders. I:
- Met with VPs to understand their teams' data skill gaps
- Invited their high-performers to present (recognition motivates)
- Shared post-event metrics showing their teams' engagement
- Positioned training as "investing in your team's capabilities"

This grassroots + top-down approach ensured attendance and participation.

**4. Creating Psychological Safety**

Many employees feared asking "dumb questions" about data. I:
- Opened every event by saying "there are no stupid questions here"
- Created anonymous Q&A channels (Slido)
- Celebrated mistakes during live demos ("I break things all the time—here's how I debug")

This reduced fear and increased engagement.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**1. User-Generated Content**

The best sessions weren't from my team—they were from business users sharing their wins. "How I used Tableau to optimize our email campaigns" resonated more than generic training because it was relatable and Chewy-specific.

**2. Vendor Partnerships**

Leveraging vendor resources was a force multiplier. We got professional training content without budget. Vendors got engaged customers. Everyone won.

**3. Progression Paths (Beginner → Advanced)**

Clearly labeled skill tracks helped users self-select appropriate content. No one felt lost or overwhelmed.

**4. Asynchronous Learning Library**

Recording sessions and making them available year-round extended impact beyond the 2-day event. The library became the "long tail" of training.

**5. Community Building**

The Slack channel became more valuable than the events themselves. It created always-on peer support that scaled better than centralized BI team support.

### What Didn't Work

**1. Single-Location Events (Pre-COVID)**

In-person events excluded remote workers. When COVID forced us virtual (2020), attendance actually increased because we removed location barriers.

**2. Overambitious Advanced Content**

Early on, we offered "expert" sessions (e.g., "Advanced Snowflake Optimization"). Attendance was <10 people. Lesson: Most users need beginner/intermediate content. Advanced content should be 1:1 or small-group.

**3. Lack of Follow-Up**

Post-event, engagement dropped. Users left excited but then didn't practice. In later years, we added "30-day challenges" (e.g., "Build one new dashboard this month") to maintain momentum.

### What I'd Do Differently

**1. Start with Async/Recorded Content**

We waited until Year 4 to build the learning library. In hindsight, recording from Day 1 would have maximized ROI.

**2. Tie Training to Career Development**

We should have formalized "data competency" in performance reviews and promotion criteria. This would have increased motivation and executive buy-in.

**3. Earlier Vendor Partnerships**

We spent Year 1-2 doing everything ourselves. Engaging vendors earlier would have scaled faster and reduced our team's burden.

## Retrospective: Impact on Career

This project taught me that **culture eats technology for breakfast**. We had world-class data infrastructure (Tableau, Snowflake, Airflow), but it sat underutilized until we invested in people's skills and confidence.

The biggest lesson: **enablement scales better than execution**. Training 1,000 people to answer their own questions creates more value than my 15-person team answering questions for them. This shifted my philosophy from "BI team as service provider" to "BI team as capability builder."

I also learned that **vendors are partners, not just vendors**. By treating Tableau, Snowflake, and Alation as collaborators (not just suppliers), we unlocked resources and expertise we couldn't have afforded. This relationship-first approach has shaped every vendor engagement since.

Finally, this program proved that **building community is as important as building platforms**. The Slack channel, peer learning, and conference connections created a self-sustaining data culture that outlasted any single tool or team. The best infrastructure is the one people actually use—and use comes from confidence, which comes from community.

This experience cemented my belief that **data leadership is 30% technology and 70% people**. The leader who invests in training, communication, and culture will outperform the leader with the fanciest tech stack.
